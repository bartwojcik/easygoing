# Easygoing - a simple, easy and secure (but still experimental) personal blog.
## TODOs:
- Automate deploy.
  - automatically add first (random or user-set password!) user
  - Ensure certbot runs so that certificate can update automatically (saved on a volume).
- Ensure robots.txt is present and site can be crawled (should this be a setting?).
- Simple file upload (same as image?) service (do not use DB).
- Configurable background (option to upload image(s)?).
- Configurable styles option (bootstrap css?) (with option to upload css?).
- Customize bootstrap?
- Add licenses view under /license url to comply with various licenses.
- Add search (haystack?).
