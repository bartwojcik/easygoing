# Easygoing - a simple, ~~easy and secure~~ experimental personal blog.
A simple blog I created for my personal needs. May be useful for someone so I put it here. (Contributions welcome!)

## TODOs: 
- Verify cron/certbot runs so that certificate can update automatically (saved on a volume).
- Simple file upload (and image?) service.
- Navbar custom image.
- Add favicon (uploadable?).
- Fix - do not leak information about existing posts (requesting existing but hidden posts redirects to login page).
- (Possibly) Configurable image background and/or styles option (if customization of bootstrap dynamically possible - upload theme.css?).
- (Possibly) Dynamic entries in Navbar.
- (Possibly) Add post author information for multi-author use case.
- (Possibly) Mitigate markdown syntax XSS vulnerabilites, so it can be also used by users.
- (Possibly) Post and Comment should be moved to the same model (tree-like content structure).
- (Possibly) Add search (haystack?).
