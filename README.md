# Easygoing - a simple, ~~easy and secure~~ experimental personal blog.
A simple blog I created for my personal needs. May be useful for someone so I put it here. (Contributions welcome!)

## TODOs: 
- Verify certbot runs so that certificate can update automatically (saved on a volume).
- Add prettier flags
- Navbar custom image and text.
- Dynamic entries in Navbar.
- Simple file upload (and image?) service.
- Add favicon (uploadable?).
- Configurable image background and/or styles option (dynamic customize bootstrap possible?).
- (Possibly) Mitigate markdown syntax XSS vulnerabilites, so it can be also used by users?
- (Possibly) Add search (haystack?).
